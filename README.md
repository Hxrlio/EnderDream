## Versions?
Currently Unreleased for Forge 1.18.2 only.

## Side?
Both sides.

## Development?
Super casual. Currently doesn't exist.

## Goal?
Since its introduction, the bed has fundamentally opposed the existing structure and meaning of Minecraft. There have been many steps along the road from Beta's true survival experience to the modern 'the only way I can die is if I do something incredibly stupid'. The bed was one of those steps. Skipping the night takes away interesting decisions and risk from the player. Beds should not be the most powerful option for self-defence.

However, having control over the day-night cycle is greatly useful to the player, and the intensity of early nights will - and should - fade away. So instead of removing this advantageous mechanic from the game, this mod simply withholds it in a lore/thematically vanilla+ manner. You may still craft a bed. You may still get in it. You may still fall asleep. But something awaits you there now. She awaits you. Do not fall into her palm, as all others have. Should she be felled, your dreams will be safe to you once again.

## Compatibility
Completely unknown. Haven't tried it with any other sleep-altering mods. That information will appear here as provided/discovered.

## Current stage?
Early Development. It just kills you when you sleep. Not released. Can clone off github though.
